Installation Instructions for Linux-based OSes
==============================================

The Deployer uses Python's setuptools for installation and building. To
install it on a Linux-based OS, do the following steps:

	tar -xzvf thedeloyer-1.0.tar.gz
	cd thedeloyer-1.0
	python setup.py install

Troubleshooting:

1. If you received an error about not finding "mysql_config", then you need to
install the MySQL client library. On Debian or Ubuntu, you could do that with:

	sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev

2.

apt-gets:
libmysqlclient15 (for mysqldump and mysql)
