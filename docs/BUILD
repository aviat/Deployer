Packaging the Source
====================

Build Instructions for Windows
==============================

You will first need to install the dependencies required for running the
build.py script.

* setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/.
* pycrypto binary from http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml.
* pysvn binary from http://pysvn.tigris.org/project_downloads.html.

With these installed, you can then run "python.exe build.py" in the source
code directory. The built binary will be stored in "dist/".

Is this needed?
